Viva Goals follows a rings-based deployment model.
The deployment pipeline MUST support very quick hot fix deployments for high priority issues 

All features MUST be shipped to both Viva Goals and legacy Ally customers, 
unless explicitly approved by Viva Goals LT. 

The development and deployment pipeline MUST be secure and compliant with Trust needs.  

Azure_Production  - This will be the base branch for all the changes deployed to Azure instances.  
Release Candidate branches in different environments (DF, SIP, Prod) - Each environment will have a different release build as each build progresses through rings of deployment. Each RC that goes to Prod rings will be preserved for future hotfix needs.
