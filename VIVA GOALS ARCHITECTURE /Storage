Azure postgreSQL- citus :
    it is primary datastore used in Viva goals. it is sql based. The data in PG is 
    sharded based on the tenant ID.

Azure cosmos DB:
    Viva Goals uses Azure cosmos DB as a cache for serialized object data from postgres.
    For example, when the client requests for the list of checkins of a given objective, 
    the application searches for the same in Cosmos and returns the data if it is present.
    Otherwise, it fetches the data from PG to construct the response, caches the same in 
    Cosmos for future requests.  

Azure Cognitive Search:
    it us used as a search engine for Viva goals.  The application caches objectives and 
    their related information such as owner etc., and tags in Azure Cognitive search.
    When the end user searches (free text search + filters) for an objective, the application 
    uses Cognitive Search to fetch the list of objectives that match the search term and returns 
    the response to the end user. 

Azure Cache for Redis:
    Azure Cache for Redis is used to store asynchronous job information required by Sidekiq within 
    Viva Goals. Sidekiq is a job processing engine than processes jobs asynchronously in parallel threads.
    Jobs are queued into Sidekiq from the main application. Sidekiq uses to store the job information 
    in Redis and later retrieves and processes it. Post processing, it deletes the information from Redis.
